\title{Find lipid class of metabolites base on referenced Kendrick mass defect}
\usage{
findlipid(list, mode = "pos")
}
\arguments{
\item{list}{list with data as peaks list, mz, rt and group information, retention time should be in seconds}

\item{mode}{'pos' for positive mode, 'neg' for negative mode and 'none' for neutral mass, only support [M+H] and [M-H] for each mode}
}
\value{
list list with dataframe with the lipid referenced Kendrick mass defect(RKMD) and logical for class
}
